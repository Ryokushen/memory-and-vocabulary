# Lexforge

Forge your vocabulary. Lexforge is a local-first RPG vocabulary trainer built around spaced repetition, free recall, cue-based recovery, and mnemonic association. It is designed to help with vocabulary retention, faster word retrieval, and fewer tip-of-the-tongue stalls for trained words.

## Product Positioning

Lexforge is best understood as an evidence-informed vocabulary retrieval trainer, not a generic brain-training app.

What it aims to improve:
- retention of practiced vocabulary
- speed and reliability of retrieving trained words
- recovery of words that are known semantically but hard to access quickly
- replacement of vague default wording with more precise vocabulary

What it does not currently claim:
- visual speed-of-processing training
- broad cognitive-transfer effects
- dementia-risk reduction

## Current Status

- 531 seeded words across three tiers, plus custom words
- Four live training modes: Recall, Context, Rapid Retrieval, and Association
- TOT capture flow for real-world blanking moments, including source, weak substitute, and context
- Difficulty settings that control daily new-word intake
- Tier gating that unlocks harder vocabulary as the player levels up
- Local-first storage with Dexie/IndexedDB
- Optional Supabase sync with GitHub OAuth for cross-device backup
- Review-log sync that keeps daily limits consistent across browsers
- PWA support with offline fallback via Serwist

## Game Modes

| Mode | Trains | Shipped behavior |
|------|--------|------------------|
| **Recall** | Clean definition-to-word retrieval | See a definition and type the word. |
| **Context** | Word choice in context | Type a stronger replacement first, then fall back to assisted options only if needed. |
| **Rapid Retrieval** | Fast verbal access | See a definition, type the word under a 5 second timer, and recover with a rescue cue if needed. |
| **Association** | Elaborative encoding | Create a vivid text association for a word, then later recall from that association. |

## Real-World Capture Loop

Lexforge now supports a dedicated TOT capture flow in the word library.

- Log the exact word that stalled in real life.
- Record what you said instead, the surrounding context, and where it happened.
- Save it onto an existing library word or create a new custom word on the spot.
- Surface those captured words earlier in sessions, with extra bias toward Recall and Rapid Retrieval.

## RPG Layer

| Stat | Represents | Current use |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **Recall** | Clean word retrieval | Grows from definition-to-word success. |
| **Retention** | Long-term review stability | Grows from spaced-review performance over time. |
| **Perception** | Rapid verbal retrieval under time pressure | Grows from Rapid Retrieval results. |
| **Creativity** | Association building and contextual flexibility | Grows from association and contextual work. |

The RPG stats are currently player-facing summaries and rewards. A later step is to use them more directly to adapt hints, pacing, and mode weighting.

Other progression systems:
- XP comes from session performance, streak bonuses, and fast clean retrieval.
- HP decays on missed days and restores on level-up.
- Difficulty changes session size and new-word intake.
- Tier gating unlocks Tier 2 at level 5 and Tier 3 at level 10.

## Technical Backbone

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) | Static-first app shell with modern React patterns |
| Local storage | Dexie.js (IndexedDB) | Typed queries, offline-ready, no mandatory backend |
| Spaced repetition | ts-fsrs | FSRS scheduler for due reviews and long-term retention |
| Animations | Framer Motion | Session transitions, stat growth, battle feedback |
| Sound | Web Audio API | Synthesized feedback tones with no audio assets |
| UI | shadcn/ui + Tailwind | Accessible primitives; game feel comes from motion and styling |
| PWA | Serwist | Service worker generation and offline fallback |
| Sync | Supabase | Optional GitHub-authenticated cloud backup and merge |
| Tooling | ESLint + TypeScript + Vitest | Linting, builds, and automated test coverage |

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run lint
npm run build
```

If you want GitHub auth and cloud sync, create `.env.local` with your Supabase project URL and anon key:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The database auto-seeds on first launch and upgrades the local Dexie profile schema as new fields are added. Without Supabase env vars, Lexforge stays fully local. If you sign in with GitHub, it also syncs profile state, review cards, review logs, and word associations to Supabase.

## Research Notes

Research documentation lives in the companion Obsidian vault. The current app is aligned with:

- spaced repetition for long-term review timing
- retrieval practice through definition-to-word production
- cue-based recovery for partial retrieval failures
- mnemonic association as elaborative encoding

The app intentionally avoids stronger claims until the mechanics and data support them.

- **Memory Recall and Brain Training** - vocabulary retrieval, tip-of-the-tongue states, and transfer limits
- **Spaced Repetition Algorithms** - FSRS vs. HLR comparison and scheduler selection
- **Gamification Psychology** - reinforcement design, motivation, and overjustification risks
- **Gamification Psychology (Web)** - novelty effects and practical product patterns

## Near-Term Roadmap

- cue-aware grading and review-log fields
- production-first context mode with MCQ fallback
- adaptive use of RPG stats in session generation
- broader automated coverage and runtime verification
