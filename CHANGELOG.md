# Changelog

All notable changes to this project should be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-04-10

### Changed

- Updated `README.md` to reflect the shipped feature set: 321 seeded words, live Recall/Context/Speed/Association modes, difficulty settings, tier gating, PWA support, and the current roadmap.
- Adjusted ESLint ignores so generated Serwist service worker artifacts in `public/` no longer pollute lint results.
- Refactored session and stats hooks for current React Compiler rules, removing effect-driven state initialization patterns that were failing lint.
- Made session UI behavior deterministic by replacing render-time randomness with stable session-derived selection in context choice ordering and battle-scene visuals.
- Simplified prompt reset behavior by relying on keyed remounts for session prompts instead of synchronous `setState` calls inside effects.
- Cleaned minor lint issues across the app, including unused imports/types and unescaped apostrophes in the offline page.

### Verified

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
